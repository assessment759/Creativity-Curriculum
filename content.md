Art
Importance (≈100 words)
Art enables children to explore representation, sensory experience and symbolic thinking while strengthening fine motor control, visual discrimination and emotional expression. Through drawing, painting, collage and sculpture, children develop confidence to make choices, solve visual problems and express ideas that may not yet be verbalised. Art experiences support identity, cultural expression and storytelling, and provide low-risk opportunities for experimentation — testing cause/effect with materials, transforming recycled objects or combining textures. Early art practice supports cross-curricular links (literacy through drawing stories; maths through pattern and symmetry) and provides rich assessment evidence of development over time.

Theories / perspectives (≈100 words)
Constructivist views (Piaget) position art as a means for constructing meaning; Vygotsky highlights social scaffolding where adult prompts and shared reflection extend children’s symbolic thinking. Reggio Emilia emphasises the environment as the “third teacher”, provocation and documentation. Dewey’s experiential learning supports process over product — valuing exploration and reflection. Gardner’s multiple intelligences validates visual-spatial expression. Process-oriented art pedagogy and sociocultural approaches guide teachers to offer open-ended provocations, intentional materials selection, and reflective documentation that link artmaking to communicative and cognitive goals.

Resources, materials & digital tech (≈100 words)
Open-ended materials: paints, brushes, collage papers, clay, glue, recycled boxes, fabrics and mark-making tools. Sensory media (sand, water, textured paint) and safe tools (scissors, staplers) for older groups. Digital tools: simple drawing apps, stop-motion apps for sequential art, tablets for digital collage and cameras for documentation. Display and documentation materials (clipboards, photo frames, reflective journals) enable ongoing assessment. Prioritise non-toxic supplies, easy clean areas, aprons and accessible storage so children can independently select and return materials.

Drama & Puppetry
Importance (≈100 words)
Drama and puppetry build imagination, emotional literacy and social communication. Acting, role play and puppetry allow children to try different perspectives, rehearse social scenarios and develop narrative skills. Such activities support language development (vocabulary, sentence building), nonverbal communication, turn-taking and empathy as children embody characters and negotiate roles. Drama is an ideal vehicle for literacy, social studies and community engagement — enabling deeper engagement with texts and social issues through active exploration and embodiment. Puppetry lowers performance pressure and allows shy children to express ideas through an intermediary.

Theories / perspectives (≈100 words)
Role-play maps to Vygotskian ideas of the zone of proximal development: adult scaffolding encourages children to achieve beyond independent capacity. Bruner’s narrative construction theory sees storying as central to cognition; Drama therapy and socio-dramatic play research highlight emotional regulation and symbolic rehearsal. Process drama frameworks (O’Toole) and puppet theatre practices provide structured progression: warm-ups, role creation, rehearsal and reflection. Sociocultural and embodied cognition theories support drama as a multimodal space for integrating language, movement and thought.

Resources, materials & digital tech (≈100 words)
Materials: simple puppets (sock, stick, glove), fabric, masks, props, boxes for stages, and costumes. Puppetry kits and storytelling cards prompt scenarios. Recording devices and cameras let children review performances and reflect. Digital story creators, simple audio editors and green-screen apps can extend production. Ensure safe performance area and accessible props. Prepare prompts and scaffolded role cards for younger groups; for older children include script templates and basic stagecraft vocabulary.

Language & Literacy
Importance (≈100 words)
Language and literacy are foundational tools for thinking, social participation and later academic success. Rich oral language experiences, shared reading, storytelling and playful phonological games build vocabulary, narrative competence and early print awareness. Literacy activities support emergent writing, symbol recognition and comprehension; they also scaffold metalinguistic skills necessary for decoding and spelling. Integrating multimodal literacy (picture, gesture, sound) ensures inclusive access for diverse learners. Literacy through creative arts fosters motivation and deeper meaning making, turning abstract concepts into relatable stories and hands-on projects.

Theories / perspectives (≈100 words)
Emergent literacy theories (Clay) emphasise that literacy develops through meaningful interactions and shared texts. Vygotsky’s social mediation highlights dialogic reading and caregiver scaffolding. Bruner’s spiral curriculum and narrative construction show how stories help children organise experience. Phonological awareness research supports play-based rhyming, segmenting and blending activities. Sociocultural literacy approaches advocate for authentic writing opportunities (lists, labels, messages) and culturally relevant texts. Multiliteracies theory supports multimodal texts (audio, visual, digital) as legitimate literacy practices in contemporary classrooms.

Resources, materials & digital tech (≈100 words)
Books (board, picture, predictable text), puppets for story retelling, letter manipulatives, magnetic letters, print-rich labels and environmental print. Writing materials (clipboards, pencils, whiteboards), drawing supplies, and listening centres for recorded stories. Digital apps for interactive stories, audio recorders for children to record retellings, and simple publishing tools to create class books. Include home-language resources and dual-language stories for multilingual contexts. Provide comfortable reading spaces, accessible book displays and routine times for shared reading and storytelling.

Science
Importance (≈100 words)
Science provokes wonder, inquiry and evidence-based reasoning. Early science experiences foster observation, prediction, testing and reflection — foundational scientific skills that transfer across domains. Hands-on investigations build curiosity, vocabulary for describing phenomena, and understanding of cause and effect. Science activities also support numeracy (measuring, comparing), language (explanations) and social skills (collaborative investigations). Offering age-appropriate materials and predictable investigative routines helps children develop hypotheses, systematically test ideas and communicate findings.

Theories / perspectives (≈100 words)
Inquiry-based learning (Kuhlthau, Bruner) emphasises active exploration and scaffolding. Constructivist approaches (Piaget) indicate children construct knowledge from active engagement; sociocultural frameworks stress guided participation and shared problem solving. Phenomenon-based learning connects science to real world contexts. Children’s science benefits from iterative cycles of question → investigate → reflect, and from teacher use of open questions and prompting to extend thinking. Conceptual change research supports targeted misconceptions remediation through hands-on evidence.

Resources, materials & digital tech (≈100 words)
Simple materials: magnifiers, measuring tools, scales, water trays, funnels, magnets and natural collections (leaves, stones). Investigation kits for buoyancy, plant growth, and simple circuits with safe batteries. Recording tools: science journals, cameras, stopwatches and measuring tapes. Digital tools: video microscopes, data logging apps and simulation tools for older children. Safety equipment, labeled storage and clear investigation areas are essential. Use everyday materials for low-cost experiments and encourage outdoor exploration for ecological learning.

Engineering
Importance (≈100 words)
Engineering in early years frames purposeful problem solving: designing, building, testing and improving artefacts that meet goals. It cultivates creativity, spatial reasoning, planning and collaboration. Engineering tasks help children transfer mathematical and scientific concepts into practical solutions and develop persistence through iterative testing. By placing constraints and goals, teachers encourage divergent thinking, trade-offs and real-world reasoning. Early engineering nurtures a maker mindset where failure is framed as information and iteration is celebrated.

Theories / perspectives (≈100 words)
Design-based learning and maker pedagogy emphasise iterative cycles of plan → build → test → redesign. Constructionism (Papert) argues that learning occurs through making shareable artefacts. Cognitive apprenticeship models recommend modelling skills, coached practice and fading assistance. Sociocultural theories highlight the importance of collaborative design talk and distributed cognition using tools and peers. Providing structured challenges with open outcomes fosters both guided and exploratory problem solving.

Resources, materials & digital tech (≈100 words)
Loose parts (blocks, connectors, cardboard), simple tools (safe scissors, tape, string), recycled materials and kits (K’NEX, LEGO) support building. Measuring tools, ramps and weights enable testing and iteration. Digital complements include coding blocks for programmable kits, design apps and simple CAD tools for older children. Storage for prototypes, a maker corner and documentation tools (cameras, reflection journals) are essential to capture iterative design thinking and explain choices.

Movement & Music — Website page (visible)
Importance (≈100 words)
Music and movement are foundational for young children, supporting sensorimotor development, language acquisition, social skills, and emotional regulation through playful interactions and guided experiences. Rhythmic activities stimulate neural circuits involved in timing, attention, memory, and pattern recognition, offering a scaffold for cognitive growth. Movement increases body awareness, coordination, and vestibular processing, while musical play promotes vocal experimentation and listening skills. Regular playful sessions provide opportunities for turn-taking, imitation and expressive choice, strengthening peer interaction and confidence. These activities are low-cost, culturally adaptable, inclusive and excellent for cross-curricular integration and assessment.

Theories / perspectives (≈100 words)
Vygotsky’s social constructivism emphasises social interaction and scaffolded learning; music and movement create contexts for co-regulation, symbolic meaning and peer-supported development. Piaget’s sensorimotor and early symbolic stages show how rhythmic and movement play foster exploration and representational thought. Gardner’s multiple intelligences highlights musical and bodily-kinesthetic competencies as legitimate pathways for learning and expression. Csikszentmihalyi’s notion of flow helps explain deep sustained engagement during immersive musical or movement tasks. Laban movement analysis and Dalcroze/Eurhythmics provide practical frameworks for observing movement quality and designing progressive, scaffolded experiences.

Resources, materials & digital tech (≈100 words)
Core resources: simple percussion (shakers, small drums), rhythm sticks, scarves, balls and open-ended props that invite movement improvisation. Low-cost recycled materials expand creative possibilities. Provide a safe, clear floor area and a portable speaker or playback device for songs and recorded prompts. Digital tools such as Chrome Music Lab, simple sequencing apps, voice recorders and basic notation apps can extend composition, documentation and reflection.

Mathematics & Numeracy
Importance (≈100 words)
Mathematics early experiences build number sense, spatial reasoning, measurement understanding and problem solving. Hands-on play with counting, sorting, patterning and measurement develops conceptual understanding and supports later formal maths. Numeracy is embedded across daily routines (snack time, block play) and through purposeful games that promote estimation, comparison and reasoning. Encouraging mathematical talk and modelling strategies supports flexible thinking and fosters confidence with quantitative concepts.

Theories / perspectives (≈100 words)
Constructivist approaches (Piaget) show that children build mathematical understanding through interaction with materials and peers. Sociocultural theories emphasise guided participation, language and cultural tools for counting and problem solving. Number sense frameworks prioritise subitising, cardinality and pattern recognition. Problem-solving models encourage heuristic strategies: act, represent, check. Playful, context-rich tasks support transfer to abstract representations and formal notation as children mature.

Resources, materials & digital tech (≈100 words)
Counting collections, number lines, base-ten manipulatives, pattern blocks, measuring tools (rulers, scales), and geometric shapes. Games for sorting, matching and estimation.
